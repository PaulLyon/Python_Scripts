# Python_Scripts
Tasks and code snippets useful for data science basics: data ingress, cleaning, analysis and presentaiton.

I've been an engineer and engineering manager for over 25 years, but my software skills historically aren't great even though I've managed software developers.

I'm interested in data science and Python and I'm adding code scripts and pieces of code that I hope are useful data science nuggets.
The intention is the code is readbale and production worthy - to that end, I may change code into functions to make it more portable.
